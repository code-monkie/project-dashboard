# Project Dashboard

My team requested an internal tool to provide upward visibility into the status of our clients. There are many existing solutions for this issue, but the team knew exactly what they wanted and asked me to put together an MVP for them to play with.

I developed this using Angular 4 / Bootstrap 4 (alpha 6) / Firebase. All told I worked on this for 10 days, as a side project - maybe 25 hours all told.
